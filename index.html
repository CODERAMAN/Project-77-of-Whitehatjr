            Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS.
            [9] Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion,
             snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. Users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts,
             preferences, and install extensions that add additional functionality.

            To open the console in Chrome, use this keyboard shortcut: Cmd + Option + J (on a Mac) or
             Cmd +Shift +J (on Windows).

             As an alternative, you could right-click on the webpage and click "Inspect"
             and the developers window will appear. Click the "Console" tab in that window.
